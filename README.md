============================================================================================================================================

Software Engineer | Java, Springboot
------------------------------------

I am Alejandro, a professional software engineer who has been a part of several remote teams that have operated in different settings for about six years now. Many successful and impactful web applications have been delivered by me thanks to professional knowledge of Java, Spring Boot and several relational databases such as MS SQL Server, Oracle and MySQL, PostgreSQL. I would, however, like to highlight the fact that the performance tests I have conducted lead me to locate bottlenecks, which I optimized and resulted in the overall system performance boost. I also applied mutation testing which enabled me to get rid of redundant unit tests, hence reducing test time. In one of my latest projects I managed to move around 10 microservices, upgrade Java and DB versions, shift the environment from PCF to OpenShift Container Platform (OCP), which led to better scaling and performance. I also have experiences working with newer cloud technologies such Open Shift and AWS,and front end components built out with Angular and micro frontends. What comes more naturally to me is the design and implementation of microservices architectures, as well as the development of REST/SOAP services. From smoke test to mutation test and integration test and performance testing using Gatling, and JMeter are the tools that I have used. I look forward to being able to incorporate new technologies and for the time being, I assimilate the Node.js and Kotlin and Scala technologies. I enjoy working in fast paced environments
